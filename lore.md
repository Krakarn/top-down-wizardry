# Creatures

## Slime

These strange, sentient balls of slime lives in almost all parts of the world.
A Slime will only attack if it is cornered or hurt,
otherwise it will attempt to escape.

## Water Slime

An evolved species of Slime, these water-based creatures have an innate ability
to absorb water to heal wounds and also multiply.
They are also more aggressive than the normal Slimes.

## Fire Slime

Fire version of the Slime creature. Like the Water Slime, these creatures can
interact with their element to heal. However, instead of multiplying they
instead gain a shield of fire around them for a while.
When the fire shield runs out, the Fire Slime explodes violently
in a large radius.
